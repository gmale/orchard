# Actions

In Sprout, we had a single proof that represented two spent notes and two new notes.
In Sapling, we had one proof per spent note and one (much simpler) proof per output note.

For Pollard, we take a middle approach:

Each action is both a spend and an output




Each action

- Each action is either a spend or an output

- Each action is both a spend and an output

## Memo fields

TODO: One memo per tx vs one memo per output
