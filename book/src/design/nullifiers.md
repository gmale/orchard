# Nullifiers

The nullifier design we use for Pollard is

$$\mathsf{nf} = [Hash_{\mathsf{nk}}(\rho) + \psi \pmod{p}] \mathcal{G} + \mathsf{cm},$$

where:
- $Hash$ is a keyed circuit-efficient hash (such as Rescue).
- $\rho$ is unique to this output. As with $\mathsf{h_{Sig}}$ in Sprout, $\rho$ includes
  the nullifiers of any Pollard notes being spent.
  - If spends and outputs are merged / combined, then we always have a nullifier
    (internally derived from a real or dummy note), and can rely on the nullifier
    derivation process to prevent an adversary from choosing dummy nullifiers arbitrarily.
  - If spends and outputs are *not* merged, then $\rho$ should probably also include
    unique information from other parts of the transaction as well.
  - TODO: Decide which of the above two cases will be used, and update this.
- $\psi$ is sender-controlled randomness. It is not required to be unique, and in practice
  is derived from a sender-selected random value $\mathsf{rseed}$.
- $\mathcal{G}$ is an fixed independent base.

This gives a note structure of

$$(addr, v, \rho, \psi, \mathsf{rcm}).$$

The nullifier commits to the note value via $\mathsf{cm}$ in order to domain-separate
nullifiers for zero-valued notes from other notes.

## Security properties

We care about several security properties for our nullifiers:

- **Balance:** can I forge money?

- **Note Privacy:** can I gain information about notes only from the public block chain?
  - This describes notes sent in-band.

- **Note Privacy (OOB):** can I gain information about notes sent out-of-band, only from
  the public block chain?
  - In this case, we assume privacy of the channel over which the note is sent, and that
    the adversary does not have access to any notes sent to the same address which are
    then spent (so that the nullifier is on the block chain somewhere).

- **Spend Unlinkability:** given the incoming viewing key for an address, and not the full
  viewing key, can I (possibly the sender) detect spends of any notes sent to that address?
  - We're giving $ivk$ to the attacker and allowing it to be the sender in order to make
    this property as strong as possible: they will have *all* the notes sent to that
    address.

- **Faerie Resistance:** can I perform a Faerie Gold attack (i.e. cause notes to be
  accepted that are unspendable)?

We assume (and instantiate elsewhere) the following primitives:

- $GH$ is a cryptographic hash into the group (such as BLAKE2s with simplified SWU), used
  to derive all fixed independent bases.
- $E$ is an elliptic curve (such as Pallas).
- $KDF$ is the note encryption key derivation function.

For our chosen design, our desired security properties rely on the following assumptions:

$$
\begin{array}{|l|l|}
\text{Balance} & DL_E \\
\text{Note Privacy} & HashDH^{KDF}_E \\
\text{Note Privacy (OOB)} & \text{Near perfect} \ddagger \\
\text{Spend Unlinkability} & DDH_E^\dagger \vee PRF_{Hash} \\
\text{Faerie Resistance} & DL_E \\
\end{array}
$$

$HashDH^{F}_E$ is computational Diffie-Hellman using $F$ for the key derivation, with
one-time ephemeral keys. This assumption is heuristically weaker than $DDH_E$ but stronger
than $DL_E$.

We omit $RO_{GH}$ as a security assumption because we only rely on the random oracle
applied to fixed inputs defined by the protocol, i.e. to generate the fixed base
$\mathcal{G}$, not to attacker-specified inputs.

> $\dagger$ We additionally assume that for any input $x$, $\{Hash_{\mathsf{nk}}(x) :
> \mathsf{nk} \in E\}$ gives a scalar in an adequate range for $DDH_E$. (Otherwise, $Hash$
> could be trivial, e.g. independent of $\mathsf{nk}$.)
>
> $\ddagger$ Statistical distance $< 2^{-167.8}$ from perfect.

problem(s) each security property depends on. They may not be accurate and are definitely
not fully rigorous.

In the above alternatives:
- $H$ is calculated by the sender as $H = GH(\rho)$, and would be provided in the action.
- $\mathcal{I}$ is an fixed independent base, independent of $\mathcal{G}$ and any others
  returned by $GH$.

For the options that use $H$, when spending a note,
- if it's a real note, then $H$ is as computed for that note, so it is a unique RO output;
- if it's a dummy note, we enforce that it is some fixed base independent of other bases.

The $Commit^{\mathsf{nf}}$ variants enabled nullifier domain separation based on note
value, without directly depending on $\mathsf{cm}$ (which in its native type is a base
field element, not a group element). We decided instead to follow Sapling by defining an
intermediate representation of $\mathsf{cm}$ as a group element, that is only used in
nullifier computation.
